        I have turned my focus in life to serving people with a focus in my life
        to work with Refugees from Natural calamities, domestic abuse and war
        conflicts With this website and my social outreach I have the hopes to
        get people more involved with humanity. More involved with serving
        people, in one of the tabs I have â€‹Get Involved Clicking in that you
        will be directed to a page where you can put your information in it and
        say what you are looking to do and what part of the world you want to
        work in. There is a podcast tab that will direct you to listen to the
        podcast. The podcast is about my personal travels and what I learned
        along with some private interviews with people to learn about them and
        their perspectives.
